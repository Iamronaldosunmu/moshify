## Overview
This project was developed from start to finish in Mosh Hamedani's Ultimate Html and css course, I followed along and was able to build this site.

## My process
This is one of the biggest projects I have worked on so far, It took more than a thousand lines of code and it was interesting to see how to maintain projects at this scale. I learned the importance of using semantic HTML5 and CSS Mark up, it makes life so easy when you come back to revisit your code. I built the websites using small components then assembled them in the end to form the final product. 
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflo

### Continued development

I've been working on a twitter clone for a while now, I'll be publishing it anytime soon, stay tuned!

### Useful resources

- [Ultimate HTML and CSS mastery](https://www.codewithmosh.com) - This is an amazing course which helped me learn HTML and CSS. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
